## Add a TODO comment indicating the reason for each rejected dependency upgrade added to this list, and what should be done to resolve it (i.e. handle it through a story, etc).
reject: [
  '@mojaloop/sdk-standard-components', # skip having to refactor ilp since simulator will be replaced in future.
  'glob'  # skip glob  10.4.5  â†’  11.0.1' because 11.0.1 required node version 20
]
